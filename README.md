## Introduction
In this project, we delve into toxic comment classification using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). With the rise of online interactions,
the prevalence of toxic comments poses significant challenges to community engagement and mental well-being. 
By leveraging ANN's ability to learn complex patterns in data, we aim to create an ultimate model that accurately identifies and categorizes toxic comments,
enhancing moderation efforts and fostering healthier online environments.
This project not only highlights the technical aspects of ANN but also underscores the importance of maintaining respectful discourse in digital spaces.

## Data Collection
Data Source => [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data)

## Data Preprocessing 
##### 1.Data set preparation(concat two datas)
##### 2.Checking for duplicates and Null values

## EDA(Exploratory Data analysis)
##### visualizing text data in our dataset
##### Using Barchart to visualize the occurance of the text
##### world cloud 

## Data Cleaning 
#### Data cleaning using regular expression
#### stemming (we'll ===> we will)

## Handling imbalance
#### we have only less no of toxic comments
#### oversampling the minority class using smote 

## Model Building 
#### ANN(Artificial Neural Networks)
#### optimizer(Adam)
#### loss(binary_cross_entropy)
#### Dropout regularzation

## model Evaluation
#### Classification report 
#### Confusion matrix
#### Sample predictions 

## conclusion
In this project, we successfully developed a Toxic Comment Classification Model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to effectively identify and classify comments that are toxic, abusive, or harmful in nature. Our model demonstrated promising results in accurately categorizing various types of toxic comments, highlighting the potential of neural networks in natural language processing tasks.
