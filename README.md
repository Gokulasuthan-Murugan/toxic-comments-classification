**Introduction**
In this project, we delve into toxic comment classification using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). With the rise of online interactions,
the prevalence of toxic comments poses significant challenges to community engagement and mental well-being. 
By leveraging ANN's ability to learn complex patterns in data, we aim to create an ultimate model that accurately identifies and categorizes toxic comments,
enhancing moderation efforts and fostering healthier online environments.
This project not only highlights the technical aspects of ANN but also underscores the importance of maintaining respectful discourse in digital spaces.
